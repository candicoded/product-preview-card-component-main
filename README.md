### What I learned
I learned a lot about the picture element. I was familiar with it, but it was the first time I've used it in a project. I had trouble getting the images to switch from the mobile to desktop version until I learned about the pictue and source element's capabilities. 

Another related problem I had to tackle was changing the border radius on the desktop image so it matched the final design. Before, it was the same as the mobile version and I learned that you couldn't style the source element separately. 

After a long break, in literally two seconds after revisiting the code, I realized I could use the same class for the mobile image to style the desktop one, and everything worked just like that.
